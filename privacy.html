<li>d. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 7.4.1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or  </li>
<li>e. for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.5 Notification obligation</span></h3> 
<p>
If you have asserted the right of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing to the controller, the controller will communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.  
</p>
<p>
You have the right to request that the controller inform you about those recipients. 
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.6 Right to data portability</span></h3>
<p>
You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided, where:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>a. the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR; and  </li>
<li>b. the processing is carried out by automated means.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In exercising your right to data portability, you have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. This shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The right to data portability shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.  
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.7 Right to object</span></h3> 
<p>
You have the right to object, on grounds relating your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. The controller will no longer process your personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Where your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. Where you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes.  
</p>
<p>
In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.  
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.8 Right to withdraw the declaration of consent regarding data protection</span></h3>
<p>
Insofar as you have given your consent for reasons of data protection, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. 
</p>
<p>
For details on withdrawal of consent for newsletters see section 6, and for tracking cookies see section 4. 
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.9 Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</span></h3>
<p>
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including 
profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This will not 
apply if the decision:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>a. is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and a data controller;  </li>
<li>b. is authorized by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays downsuitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or  </li>
<li>c. is based on the data subject's explicit consent. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Decisions referred to in the points above are not based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) EU GDPR applies and suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.  
</p>
<p>
In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of this section, the controller will implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.  
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.10 Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</span></h3>
<p>
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes this Regulation. 
</p>
<p>
The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged will inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78 EU-GDPR 
</p>

<h3 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">7.11. Lawfulness of processing</span></h3>
<p>
If we obtain the data subject’s consent to the processing of his or her personal data, point (a) of Article 6(1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing. 
</p>
<p>
If processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, point b of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.  
</p>
<p>
If processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, point (c) of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR provides the legal basis. 
</p>
<p>
If processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, point (d) of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR provides the legal basis. 
</p>
<p>
If the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of MOABI or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, then point (f) of Article 6(1) EU-GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing. The legitimate interest of our company lies in the performance of our business activities. 
</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">8. Links to third-party websites</span></h2>
<p>
MOABI websites may contain links to other websites. If you follow these links, you will leave the MOABI websites and also the scope of validity of this statement, which does not cover other such websites. MOABI cannot assume any responsibility whatsoever, neither for the privacy policy nor the content of these other websites. 
</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">9. Contact form and email traffic</span></h2>
<p>
A contact form is available on MOABI websites for electronic contact. The data you enter on the form will be transferred to MOABI and saved. 
</p>
<p>
Data that is transferred: 
</p>
<p>
Title, first name, last name, email address, phone number, company name, country, address and any data you enter in the request. 
It is also possible to contact us by email instead. In this case, the personal data you send by email will be stored. 
</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">10. Storage period of personal data</span></h2>
<p>
Your personal data will only be stored by MOABI (and, if applicable, by its service providers) for as long as allowed, in particular as long as the data is required for the agreed purpose or for compliance with legal obligations. When the purpose of the processing no longer exists, the data is erased. 
</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead"><span style="color:#446CDE;font-weight:bolder">11. Changes to the statement of privacy</span></h2>
<p>
MOABI reserves the right to change this statement at any time. We would therefore ask that you check the statement of privacy at regular intervals. If substantial changes are made, a notification to that effect will be published on our homepage. 
</p>
<p>
We inform registered users and customers by email about significant changes to this statement of privacy.
